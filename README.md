# Laser Sword V2
(Original mod and concept (unmaintained): https://github.com/Roberto5/laser_mod/tree/master)
(Revamped mod(V1): https://forum.luanti.org/viewtopic.php?t=10642)

This is a revamp of the original laser mod. This mod features:
- Laser swords that mine all types of nodes
- Deals 12 fleshy damage
- A right-clickable ability (for the laser swords) which pushes objects away from the user
- Code optimisation. Possibly easier to maintain code
